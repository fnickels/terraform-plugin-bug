# terraform-plugin-bug

Reported in https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31442

This repository is used to reproduce a bug detected in the terraform cli v1.2.5 and earlier

Checked versions: v.1.0.5, v1.2.5

To reproduce, run:

```bash
make
```

The Output will look like:

```
$ make
#
# Build Local Mirror
#
rm -rf ./mirror1 ./app1/terraform.d
terraform -chdir=./providermirror1 \
        providers mirror -platform=linux_amd64 ../mirror1/terraform/plugins

  - Selected v4.21.0 to meet constraints 4.21.0

  - Package authenticated: signed by HashiCorp
#
# copy mirror files to local defaulr pluging directories
#
cp -r ./mirror1/terraform ./app1/terraform.d
#
# Test without -chdir  and local plugin directory
#
rm -rf ./app1/.terraform  ./app1/terraform.tfstate ./app1/.terraform.tfstate.lock.info  ./app1/.terraform.lock.hcl
cd ./app1 && terraform init

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Note: with the `-chdir` working directory specification with the second `terraform init` results in v4.22.0 of `hashicorp/aws` being pulled in instead of v4.21.0 which was defined in the mirror and pulled in in the first `terraform init` results.

Suspect the search for the `terraform.d/plugins` directory in the current working directory is not checking to see if the current working directory has been reassigned with `-chdir`.
